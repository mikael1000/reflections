Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When I develop open source, want to share what I do or just want to show off what I'm capable of doing.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: If you are working on something that isn't ready (or you don't want to show).

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks is when I want to make my own verion of someones else project or "make it better" so I can propose an master update.
   The clone is when I don't have anything on my computer I start with a clone. Branches is when I want to experiment and try
   a new function.
